Program for calculating the volume of the cylinder

Assignment
It is necessary to create a Java program that will calculate the volume of a cylinder whose radius is 10 and whose height is 50.

The required formula for calculating the volume of the roller is:

V = r2 * Pi * H

r – radius of the base of the roller
H – height
Pi – constant Pi, 3.14


The obtained value should be printed on the output.
